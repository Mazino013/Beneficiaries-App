## Features
- **Beneficiary Information App**: An application that displays information about an account holder's beneficiaries.
- Utilzed LiveData, ensuring efficient and reliable data retrieval.
- UI is built programmatically without XML layouts.
- RecyclerView is used for efficient list display.
- Fragments are used for modularity and easier navigation.
- JSON parsing is done using native JSONObject/JSONArray.

 ## Architecture
- Built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture, a design pattern that separates the user interface logic from the business logic. This architecture enhances code organization, maintainability, and testability.

 
## Potential Improvements
- Implement a more robust navigation system (NavHost, NavContoller).
- Display a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
- Use ConstraintLayout for more precise control over the layout
